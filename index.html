			<p>BetterCompass is a political quiz that places you on a two-axis grid, inspired by the Political Compass. The x-axis is for economics and the y-axis is for the role of the state. The first part of the quiz is on economics and the second is on the role of the state, and changes depending on how you answered the first.</p>
			<p><strong>Work in progress--only the economic axis works at the moment.</strong></p>
